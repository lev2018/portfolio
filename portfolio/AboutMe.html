        <p>My name is Lydia Vazquez and I am a game designer and beginner animator based in Manhattan, New York. I do both 2D and 3D design using 3d software and hand drawings. I create my own games currently but I am also interested in doing freelance work as well.</p>

        <h2>How I got into games</h2>
        
        <p> I didn’t really think about what I wanted to do much not until I started getting into watching let’s plays of video games on youtube. As I watched them play the games I noticed all the artwork in the games and the character designs and it reminded me of my artwork. I thought it would be fun to make games like the ones I saw because it would allow me to display my character designs and tell their stories.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Reason why</h2>
        <p>I also saw how much playing video games can affect people by making them feel better or simply taking their minds off their problems even if it was only for a little while. Like games did for me when I was younger, whenever I was stressed about anything that was going on they would help me relax and take my mind off of it. Playing games still does help me so if I can I want to do that for anyone else with my games.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Incluences</h2>
        <p>My artwork and character designs are mostly influenced by greek mythology and fantasy in general. The music I listen to are rock and pop which can sometimes influence how I design a character. While listening to either a specific or a couple of songs I get an idea of a character that the songs would either be about or that they listen to. This also affects the genres I mostly work with which would be fantasy and horror. I use a lot of dark colors but I also like to use bright neon colors.</p>
